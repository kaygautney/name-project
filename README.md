# Name Project 
This program reads a list of names from 'names.txt' into an ArrayList, sorts them A-Z, then builds a second ArrayList that contains only the first name for each letter (A-Z). The second list is sorted (Z-A) and written to 'sortednames.txt'

# Files

'names.txt' - input file 
'sortednames.txt' - output file generated by the program 

# How to Run

2. Run 'NameProject'
3. Check 'sortednames.txt' for the results
